About
=====

This script is intended to scan subtitle files (or folders containing subtitle files) and prompt to remove cells with advertising. Subtitle files may be searched via regular expression or plaintext. The script can handle srt subtitle files natively or other formats (ass, srt, ssa, sub) via the Python module **aeidon**.


Installation
============

::

  pip3 install subnuker

The :code:`subnuker` package is known to be compatible with Python 3.

Subnuker can process srt subtitle files right out of the box. If you wish to handle other types of subtitle files (ass, srt, ssa, sub), you'll need to install the aeidon module.

On Debian/Ubuntu, try:

::

  sudo apt-get install python3-aeidon

Or download the tarball for Gaupol_.
After unpacking, run:

::

  python3 setup.py --user --without-gaupol clean install

Additional information on installing Gaupol is available here:

Usage
=====

From the command line, run :code:`subnuker --help` to display available options.

You may scan srt subtitle files with or without the regex flag, though there are likely to be less false positives with regex:

::

  subnuker --regex FILE1.srt FILE2.srt FILE3.srt

Or scan entire folders containing srt subtitle files:

::

  subnuker FOLDER1 FOLDER2 FOLDER3

By default, `subnuker` scans subtitles with a built-in list of plaintext search terms or regular expression. Subnuker can also obtain patterns from multiple pattern files, similar to :code:`grep`'s :code:`--file` option.

::

  subnuker --file PATTERNFILE FILE.srt

The :code:`--aeidon` option indicates the use of the aeidon module. The aeidon module has full support for all options:

::

  subnuker --aeidon FILE.srt
